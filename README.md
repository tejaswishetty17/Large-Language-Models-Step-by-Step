📚 Large Language Models Step-by-Step
This repository is a hands-on, structured guide to understanding and working with Large Language Models (LLMs) — one step at a time. It’s designed for learners and practitioners who want to go beyond just using LLMs and start understanding how they work under the hood.

Through this tutorial, you'll learn:

🤖 What LLMs are and how they differ from traditional NLP models

🧱 Core components: tokenization, embeddings, attention, and transformers

🧠 How pretraining and fine-tuning work in LLMs

🛠️ How to use popular frameworks (like Hugging Face Transformers) to build and run your own models

🔄 Practical demos with inference, prompt engineering, and evaluation

Each concept is broken down with simple code, visuals, and real-world analogies to help you build a strong intuition for how LLMs operate.# Large-Language-Models-Step-by-Step
